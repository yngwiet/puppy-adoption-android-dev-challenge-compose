            "Vetting: Core vaccines (dhpp and rabies), neutered, microchipped, dewormed, fecal - negative, 4dx bloodwork - negative, heartworm - negative, full blood panel - normal, skin cytology originally showed a fungal and skin infection which has been cured, on tick/heartworm and flea prevention. DJ came in severely underweight with a horrendous skin and fungal infection where there was also a lot of hair loss. After a regime of medicated baths, lots of medication, multiple vet visits, and a change in diet DJ has flourished. Please note that he is eating kangaroo kibble, kangaroo treats and needs to have a medicated bath once a week. He is on 1 allergy meds/day and is currently doing very well by restricting diet to only kangaroo and having baths. He goes to the vets every 6 weeks or so to have his anal glands drained.\n" +
            "Housebroken? Yes!\n" +
            "Good with Dogs? He has 2 dog friends at the park (both medium size), he plays off leash with and is always playful and a little timid, he is never aggressive. He does seem to show a little aggression toward small dogs though.\n" +
            "Good with Cats? No.\n" +
            "Good with Children? Unknown, but gets scared of kids when they are loud if they were passed on a walk, so would say no kids is best!\n" +
            "Any noted prey drive? Yes! He will go after squirrels, birds and cats.\n" +
            "How do they respond to the outdoors? He loves the outdoors, but prefers quieter neighbourhoods. He loves to run. He will go to the beach but won’t go into the water!\n" +
            "Busy Streets? Does not like busy streets, at all! He doesn’t mind the cars, or the people so much. But he gets very scared by loud noises! Specifically by skateboards, rollerbladers, groups of loud kids.\n" +
            "What type of exercise do they get and how much? He goes on daily 5km runs to the water, plus a few walks in the neighbourhood.\n" +
            "How active are they? Extremely high energy and very active! He can out-run people, and is very hyper in the house.\n" +
            "Crate-Trained? Yes, he is crate trained! He is left uncrated if leaving the house for less than 4 hours, but anything more than that he is crated.\n" +
            "Walks well on leash? He is great on a leash! Can get hyper and pull but is pretty good at listening to commands! If he gets “spooked” while on a walk (which happens much less now - but is caused by sudden loud noises like construction or alot of trucks going by), he will however still pull and just want to go home.\n" +
            "How do they respond to commands? He responds very well to commands.\n" +
            "Are they vocal? If so, in what way? Yes! Mostly inside! He will bark when people come and go from the house. If the sound of cars or people outside wake him up in the night, he will bark.\n" +
            "How do they handle transit or car transportation? He behaves in cars, however gets extremely car sick when in a car for over 30 minutes. Car rides are limited to just going to the vets.\n" +

            "New year, new DJ! This playful boy has improved greatly with his foster, learning and responding well to commands, and can be left alone for a short period of time now. This DJ will have your heart spinning. DJ is a super sweet dog who is very cuddly and will just want to spend all his time with you. He is highly energetic and loves to run around outside and is the happiest when he can run around off leash with his toys. This hyper boy loves to play with people and can get a little nippy just like a puppy, however he’s usually very gentle. He’s a big hyper boy who likes to play a little rough, but never takes it too far. He is a chewer and more training in this area would benefit him. DJ can be left alone without being crated for up to 4 hours now. Lots of exercise, toys to keep him occupied and busy, turn this active boy into a big sleepy cuddly puppy.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "He would do well with a highly active family with no kids and no other pets in a quiet neighbourhood or rural property with a fenced-in backyard for him to play and run around in. He benefits from going on a run or a long walk in the morning to use up some of his extra energy. This big cuddler would like a family who is comfortable having him sleep in their bed, hang out on the couch and even in your lap! He loves people so much, at least one person who works from home is optimal for him. DJ had a severe skin infection and possibly food allergies so is on a restricted diet of eating only Kangaroo kibble and Kangaroo treats, and has improved greatly on this diet. If you think you can give this very sweet boy DJ, a loving home please contact adopt@covetedcanines.org.",
